**RECOGNISABLE OPERATIONS**
- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b

**CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS**
**i, eli and else are the primary conditional statements**
`x = 10`
`if x > 0:`
`    print("Positive")`
`elif x == 0:`
`    print("Zero")`
`else:`
`    print("Negative")`
*In this example, the if statement checks if x is greater than 0. If this condition is true, it executes the code within that block. If x is not greater than 0, the elif statement checks if x is equal to 0. If not, the else statement executes, indicating that x is negative. Conditional statements are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program.*

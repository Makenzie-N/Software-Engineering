**Analysis**
*Break down the problem and look carefully at the details and data.*

# Scenario: Imagine your class raises money for a good cause each month. You have a list of how much money (a number) you raised in each month of the year. 

How can you figure out which month raised the most money? 
Form a column graph, one column for each month. This will provide a clear distinction of the difference of each month's earnings and therefore show which month raised the most money.

What steps would you take to use and organise these numbers to find the answer?
I would ensure to clearly label each axis, column and remember to add a title to my graph. I would put the months in order and convert all the amounts of money into cents so it is exactly the same value for each month's amount of money ensuring it will show a correct difference.

**Evaluation**
*Think about how to compare information and decide what is best or most useful.*

# Scenario: Your class is choosing between two field trips: a museum or a zoo. The class votes on the options (each student picks one). 

How would you organise and use the voting results (the number of votes for each option) to decide which trip is more popular? 
I would create a pie chart to explore the difference in percentage between the two options and show what one was most preferred.

What information would you compare to evaluate the best choice for the class?
The percentage of people who choose each option would determine which was most preferred, this would be shown clearly as a pie chart.

**Application**
*Use what you know about data to solve a real-world problem or task.*

# Scenario: You are planning a class party. 

What data would you collect to help plan (for example, the number of people coming, each person's favorite snack, and if anyone has an allergy yes/no)? 
I would collect the following data:
- Allergies
- Number of people coming
- Favourite snack
- Favourite drink

How would you organise this information to decide how much food and drink to get and make sure everyone has something they can enjoy?
I would create a google form so people can answer yes/no about whether they are coming and can also write which is their favourite snack, drink and what their allergies are (if they have some). I would then be able to see the results of this form and easily see a list of favourite foods, favourite drinks, allergies and the number of people coming.

**Synthesis**
*Combine pieces of information to form a complete picture or new idea.*

# Scenario: Your teacher has one list of students with perfect attendance and another list of students with top grades. Both lists are names (text data). 

How could you put these two lists together to find out which students are on both lists? 
I would make a table with both lists sitting next to each other. One column for students with perfect attendance and another for students with top grades.

Why would it help to organise the names clearly (for example, alphabetically or in a table) when looking for students that appear in both sets of data?
It would help to organise the names in alphabetical order so the names which are in both lists roughly line up and therefore make it easier to spot whether each name is in both lists.

**Critical Thinking**
*Question the data and think about whether it is fair, accurate, or useful.*

# Scenario: Imagine a toy ad says, "90% of kids love this toy!" You find out they only asked 10 kids and 9 said they loved it (yes). 

What might be wrong or unfair about this data? 
They may have only asked kids of the same age, they didn't ask a lot of people and therefore increased the possibility that the percentage of kids who liked it was higher.

What questions would you ask before believing the adâ€™s claim (for example, Is 10 kids a big enough sample? Did they ask a fair mix of different kids?)? 
I would ask them to survey many more people of different gender and age too. I would make sure all the kids they surveyed have had a chance to actually play with this toy so they aren't judging it based on looks.

Explain why you would or wouldn't trust this claim based on the data.
Because I have no idea who they surveyed and for all I know they may have asked 10 kids who are all 8 year old girls and this is unfair because 'kids' is a general term varying in age and gender. I also wouldn't trust this data because the kids may have only seen the toy and never played with it.

**Creative Thinking**
*Use your imagination to solve a problem or improve something using data in a new way.*

# Scenario: Imagine you want to get everyone to read more books by holding a fun contest at school. Think of a creative way to use data in this contest. For example, you could track how many pages or books each class reads (numbers) or have students vote for their favorite book (yes/no votes or a list of titles). 

What data would you collect?
I would track how many books each student reads. 

How would you use it to make the reading contest both fair and exciting?
I would get kids to write the title of the book they are reading when they start so I can determine the amount of points that specific book would earn them as the size of the book would determine the amount of points earned (say 100 pages = 1 point). Points would add up and earn students prizes like a canteen voucher for example.

I would also create a library display with the most popular books of the week so students always have a recommendation of what to read during the competition.
